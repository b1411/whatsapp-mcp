"""Transcription worker: one request per line of JSON in, one line of JSON out.

Whisper is loaded here rather than in the MCP server so that the server process
never imports CUDA libraries, never blocks its event loop on a long decode, and
survives a crash in the speech stack. The worker stays alive between requests,
so the model is loaded once.
