# WhatsApp MCP Server

> **Fork notice.** This is a fork of [lharries/whatsapp-mcp](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp), which has had no code changes since April 2025 while 150+ pull requests sit open. It carries these changes on top of upstream:
>
> - **Fixes `Client outdated (405)`** — upstream pins a March 2025 build of whatsmeow that WhatsApp now refuses outright, so a fresh clone of upstream cannot connect at all.
> - **Fixes every media download failing with `403`** — the direct path was rebuilt from the media URL by string surgery, which dropped the query string carrying its access tokens, so images, video, documents and voice notes were all unreachable.
> - **Adds media viewing** - `view_image` and `view_video` return pictures and video frames as images plus a transcript, so photos and video messages can actually be seen. See [Watching Videos](#watching-videos).
> - **Adds local voice message transcription** — `transcribe_audio` and `transcribe_audio_file`, running faster-whisper on your own machine, with optional CUDA acceleration. See [Voice Message Transcription](#voice-message-transcription).
>
> The two features are also offered upstream as [PR #359](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp/pull/359) and [PR #360](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp/pull/360).
>
> **If you just want a maintained WhatsApp MCP server, use [verygoodplugins/whatsapp-mcp](https://github.com/verygoodplugins/whatsapp-mcp) instead.** It is a far more developed fork with regular releases, tests and an active maintainer, and it already tracks a current whatsmeow. This fork exists because it additionally has GPU-accelerated transcription working on Windows, which that one does not yet.


This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for WhatsApp.

With this you can search and read your personal Whatsapp messages (including images, videos, documents, and audio messages), search your contacts and send messages to either individuals or groups. You can also send media files including images, videos, documents, and audio messages.

It connects to your **personal WhatsApp account** directly via the Whatsapp web multidevice API (using the [whatsmeow](https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow) library). All your messages are stored locally in a SQLite database and only sent to an LLM (such as Claude) when the agent accesses them through tools (which you control).

Here's an example of what you can do when it's connected to Claude.

> *Caution:* as with many MCP servers, the WhatsApp MCP is subject to [the lethal trifecta](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/16/the-lethal-trifecta/). This means that project injection could lead to private data exfiltration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go
- Python 3.6+
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app (or Cursor)
- UV (Python package manager), install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- FFmpeg (_optional_) - Only needed for audio messages. If you want to send audio files as playable WhatsApp voice messages, they must be in `.ogg` Opus format. With FFmpeg installed, the MCP server will automatically convert non-Opus audio files. Without FFmpeg, you can still send raw audio files using the `send_file` tool.

### Steps

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp.git
   cd whatsapp-mcp
   ```

2. **Run the WhatsApp bridge**

   Navigate to the whatsapp-bridge directory and run the Go application:

   ```bash
   cd whatsapp-bridge
   go run main.go
   ```

   The first time you run it, you will be prompted to scan a QR code. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app to authenticate.

   After approximately 20 days, you will might need to re-authenticate.

3. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "whatsapp": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}", // Run `which uv` and place the output here
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/whatsapp-mcp/whatsapp-mcp-server", // cd into the repo, run `pwd` and enter the output here + "/whatsapp-mcp-server"
           "run",
           "main.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop / Cursor**

   Open Claude Desktop and you should now see WhatsApp as an available integration.

   Or restart Cursor.

### Windows Compatibility

If you're running this project on Windows, be aware that `go-sqlite3` requires **CGO to be enabled** in order to compile and work properly. By default, **CGO is disabled on Windows**, so you need to explicitly enable it and have a C compiler installed.

#### Steps to get it working:

1. **Install a C compiler**  
   We recommend using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install a C compiler for Windows. After installing MSYS2, make sure to add the `ucrt64\bin` folder to your `PATH`.  
   → A step-by-step guide is available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).

2. **Enable CGO and run the app**

   ```bash
   cd whatsapp-bridge
   go env -w CGO_ENABLED=1
   go run main.go
   ```

Without this setup, you'll likely run into errors like:

> `Binary was compiled with 'CGO_ENABLED=0', go-sqlite3 requires cgo to work.`

## Architecture Overview

This application consists of two main components:

1. **Go WhatsApp Bridge** (`whatsapp-bridge/`): A Go application that connects to WhatsApp's web API, handles authentication via QR code, and stores message history in SQLite. It serves as the bridge between WhatsApp and the MCP server.

2. **Python MCP Server** (`whatsapp-mcp-server/`): A Python server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides standardized tools for Claude to interact with WhatsApp data and send/receive messages.

### Data Storage

- All message history is stored in a SQLite database within the `whatsapp-bridge/store/` directory
- The database maintains tables for chats and messages
- Messages are indexed for efficient searching and retrieval

## Usage

Once connected, you can interact with your WhatsApp contacts through Claude, leveraging Claude's AI capabilities in your WhatsApp conversations.

### MCP Tools

Claude can access the following tools to interact with WhatsApp:

- **search_contacts**: Search for contacts by name or phone number
- **list_messages**: Retrieve messages with optional filters and context
- **list_chats**: List available chats with metadata
- **get_chat**: Get information about a specific chat
- **get_direct_chat_by_contact**: Find a direct chat with a specific contact
- **get_contact_chats**: List all chats involving a specific contact
- **get_last_interaction**: Get the most recent message with a contact
- **get_message_context**: Retrieve context around a specific message
- **send_message**: Send a WhatsApp message to a specified phone number or group JID
- **send_file**: Send a file (image, video, raw audio, document) to a specified recipient
- **send_audio_message**: Send an audio file as a WhatsApp voice message (requires the file to be an .ogg opus file or ffmpeg must be installed)
- **download_media**: Download media from a WhatsApp message and get the local file path
- **transcribe_audio**: Transcribe a voice message from a chat to text, locally
- **transcribe_audio_file**: Transcribe any local audio file to text, locally
- **view_image**: Look at an image message - returns the picture itself, not a file path
- **view_image_file**: The same for any local image file
- **view_video**: Watch a video message - returns frames as images plus a transcript of its audio
- **view_video_file**: The same for any local video file

### Media Handling Features

The MCP server supports both sending and receiving various media types:

#### Media Sending

You can send various media types to your WhatsApp contacts:

- **Images, Videos, Documents**: Use the `send_file` tool to share any supported media type.
- **Voice Messages**: Use the `send_audio_message` tool to send audio files as playable WhatsApp voice messages.
  - For optimal compatibility, audio files should be in `.ogg` Opus format.
  - With FFmpeg installed, the system will automatically convert other audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.) to the required format.
  - Without FFmpeg, you can still send raw audio files using the `send_file` tool, but they won't appear as playable voice messages.

#### Media Downloading

By default, just the metadata of the media is stored in the local database. The message will indicate that media was sent. To access this media you need to use the download_media tool which takes the `message_id` and `chat_jid` (which are shown when printing messages containing the meda), this downloads the media and then returns the file path which can be then opened or passed to another tool.


#### Voice Message Transcription

Voice messages can be transcribed to text locally with [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), so audio never leaves your machine and no API key is needed.

- **transcribe_audio** takes a `message_id` and `chat_jid`, downloads the voice message and returns its transcript.
- **transcribe_audio_file** does the same for any local audio file.

Both accept an optional `language` hint (auto-detected otherwise), `translate_to_english`, `with_timestamps` for per-segment times, and `model_size` to override the model.

The model is downloaded on first use and cached in memory afterwards, so only the first call is slow. FFmpeg is used to normalise the audio, and is already a prerequisite for sending voice messages.

Whisper runs in a small worker process rather than inside the MCP server. That keeps the speech stack and its CUDA libraries out of the served process, and keeps a long decode off the event loop, where it would otherwise block every other tool call. The worker stays alive between requests, so the model is loaded once: the first call takes about 16s and later ones about 2.5s on an RTX 5050.

Configuration via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `large-v3-turbo` | Any faster-whisper model, e.g. `tiny`, `base`, `small`, `large-v3` |
| `WHISPER_DEVICE` | `auto` | `cuda`, `cpu`, or `auto` to try CUDA and fall back to CPU |
| `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` | `float16` on CUDA, `int8` on CPU | CTranslate2 compute type |
| `WHISPER_WORKER_TIMEOUT` | `900` | Seconds to wait for the worker before giving up |

Transcription runs on the CPU out of the box. For GPU acceleration on an NVIDIA card, install the optional CUDA libraries:

```bash
cd whatsapp-mcp-server
uv sync --extra cuda
```

The server locates these wheels itself, so no system-wide CUDA installation or `PATH` changes are required. If the GPU is unusable for any reason, it falls back to the CPU automatically.


#### Viewing Images

**view_image** returns an image message as picture content instead of a file path, so the image can be seen directly by clients that have no filesystem access. **view_image_file** does the same for a local file. Images are downscaled to `max_dimension` (1024px by default) before being returned, since one full-resolution photo would otherwise cost far more context than it is worth.

#### Watching Videos

**view_video** turns a video message into something a model can actually look at: a set of frames returned as image content, plus a transcript of the audio. Frames come back as images rather than file paths, so clients with no filesystem access can see them too. **view_video_file** does the same for a local file.

By default frames are taken **at scene changes**, which shows what actually happens in the video instead of whatever a fixed timer lands on. Videos with fewer than three detected cuts, and those longer than 10 minutes (where scene detection would mean decoding the whole file), fall back to even sampling.

Because every frame costs context, the frame count is capped rather than the interval fixed: a ten-minute video sampled every five seconds would return 120 images.

| Argument | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_frames` | 8 | Upper bound on returned frames |
| `interval_seconds` | auto | Force a fixed interval instead of automatic selection |
| `max_dimension` | 640 | Longest side of each frame, in pixels |
| `transcribe` | true | Also transcribe the audio track |
| `mode` | `auto` | `auto`, `scenes` or `interval` |

Videos with no audio track are reported as such rather than failing.

## Technical Details

1. Claude sends requests to the Python MCP server
2. The MCP server queries the Go bridge for WhatsApp data or directly to the SQLite database
3. The Go accesses the WhatsApp API and keeps the SQLite database up to date
4. Data flows back through the chain to Claude
5. When sending messages, the request flows from Claude through the MCP server to the Go bridge and to WhatsApp

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues when running uv, you may need to add it to your PATH or use the full path to the executable.
- Make sure both the Go application and the Python server are running for the integration to work properly.

### Authentication Issues

- **QR Code Not Displaying**: If the QR code doesn't appear, try restarting the authentication script. If issues persist, check if your terminal supports displaying QR codes.
- **WhatsApp Already Logged In**: If your session is already active, the Go bridge will automatically reconnect without showing a QR code.
- **Device Limit Reached**: WhatsApp limits the number of linked devices. If you reach this limit, you'll need to remove an existing device from WhatsApp on your phone (Settings > Linked Devices).
- **No Messages Loading**: After initial authentication, it can take several minutes for your message history to load, especially if you have many chats.
- **WhatsApp Out of Sync**: If your WhatsApp messages get out of sync with the bridge, delete both database files (`whatsapp-bridge/store/messages.db` and `whatsapp-bridge/store/whatsapp.db`) and restart the bridge to re-authenticate.
